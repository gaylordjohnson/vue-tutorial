This tutorial is based on a series of YouTube videos here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZY1yyrlJWU
To run it, simply open the index.html file (no need to run local http server)

*********** NOTE ***********
As of the current commit, I've left off the tutorial on video #6 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyr5X5HwXhM) at timestamp 3'0"
(Just went through how to delete entries - both on the server and locally - and about to learn how to edit entries).

ALSO NOTE: 
I'm using dummy REST API server, which doesn't persist data, so deletions and edits won't wctually save the changes. 
So if I refresh the app, it's all back to how it was before the changes.
